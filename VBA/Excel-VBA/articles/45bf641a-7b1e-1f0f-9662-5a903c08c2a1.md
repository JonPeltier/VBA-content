# Series.PlotColorIndex Property (Excel)

Returns an index value that is used internally to associate series formatting with chart elements. Read-only


## Syntax

 _expression_ . **PlotColorIndex**

 _expression_ A variable that represents a **[Series](c7d34b32-8172-f7a0-0a17-f01d44246b64.md)** object.


### Return Value

 **Integer**


## Remarks

This property is used internally by Excel to determine which ObjectThemeColor and Brightness are used in the default formatting of a series. For example, Series 1 through 6 are formatted with Accent Colors 1 through 6 and Brightness 0, Series 7 through 12 are also formatted with Accent Colors 1 through 6 but with Brightness -0.4, Series 13 through 18 are formatted with Accent Colors 1 through 6 but with Brightness 0.2, and Series 19 through 24 are also formatted with Accent Colors 1 through 6 but with Brightness -0.2. 

The PlotColorIndex is assigned to a series when it is created, and it keeps that PlotColorIndex--and its default color formatting--even if its PlotOrder is changed.

PlotColorIndex is the only way to determine what default Theme Color is applied to a series.

## Example

This code example will determine indirectly which default ObjectThemeColor is applied to a given series.

```vb
Dim iPlotColorIndex As Integer
Dim msoColorIndex as MsoThemeColorSchemeIndex
iPlotColorIndex = Charts("Chart1").SeriesCollection(1).PlotColorIndex
Select Case (iPlotColorIndex - 1) Mod 6 + 1
  Case 1
    msoColorIndex = msoThemeAccent1
  Case 2
    msoColorIndex = msoThemeAccent2
  Case 3
    msoColorIndex = msoThemeAccent3
  Case 4
    msoColorIndex = msoThemeAccent4
  Case 5
    msoColorIndex = msoThemeAccent5
  Case 6
    msoColorIndex = msoThemeAccent6
End Select
```
